ecell---A basic elementary cellular automata generator

Usage: ecell [[OPTION] [PARAMETER]]
Produces elementary cellular automata.

Arguments that take parameters require said parameters.  Can be run without arguments, at which point any needed parameters are set randomly.
	-r	[RULE]		use rule specified (8-bit unsigned int)
	-p	[POPULATION]	use initial population (32-bit unsigned int)
	-q			"quiet mode", no command line output
	-v			"verbose mode", prints everything and the
					kitchen sink to the command line
	-o	[OUTFILENAME]	prints generated populations to output file.
	-h			prints this help and exit

If both -q and -v are entered, or arguments are improperly specified, or any other kind of slip-up, throws hands in the air, prints help, and quits.

TO DO:
- Allow for arbitrary-sized initial populations (within limits)---would likely mean removing parameter-initialized populations and adding manual population specification.
- Allow for 3-, 5-, and 7-space perspectives for cells, rather than just 3-space.
- Read from file and print automata---would require altering how output to file is organized.
